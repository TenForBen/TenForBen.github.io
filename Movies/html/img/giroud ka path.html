 Hey Hey Hey, Goodbye

[Lady Gaga: Chorus]
 Lookin at, Lookin at, Lookin at me
 Look at that, Look at how they lookin at me
 Eye's all sticky like honey on Bee's
 Look at that, Look at how they lookin at me
a
[Wale]
 DC chillin, PG chillin 
 My name Wale and I came to get it 
 Came to get it, came to get it 
 My name Wale (Wale Wale)

[Wale: Verse 1] 
 This how you start of 09 
 Kickin in the door, and I'm everybody problem 
 Stuntin in some other Jordan Nines 
 I got Phil Knight talkin about "How you got them? " 
 Let's talk about the cars ya'll got 
 You say you got alotta whips, well I got a Lot 
 I got the right to be cocky 
 Get so much cut disc jockeys jock me 
 You niggas mad that you not me 
 I remain a Giant and your Jeremy Shockey 
 And if you ain't heard me properly 
 If you speak garbage, then we no capice 
 DC chillin, PG chillin, floor to the ceilin 
 Stuntin in my Billion-Air, gear on my 
 Millionaire Frames, that's money on my mind, Wale 

[Lady GaGa: Bridge] 
 Get em all, get em all, pack it all up 
 Stack up your funds like a million bucks 
 Across the pond, they all know us 
 International... Whoaaaa! 
 Driving my car to a foreign place 
 Lookin at me, now they know my face 
 We want it all now, we got all YESSSS 
 Look At That, Look at how they lookin at usss 

[Wale: Verse 2] 
 Yea, they keep sayin whale but my name Wal-e 
 Ho's call me "Mr. Never Wear The Same Thang" 
 You redundant, you never ever change 
 And I'm the same way, M.I.A. 
 And me Cool and Dre get high like planes 
 Your man Wale in his own damn lane 
 Can't control the box, you are no Mills Lane 
 Ain't heard DC since Sardines came 
 Ha! And I made ya'll love it 
 We don't cop plea's, but ya'll don't cop nothin 
 Police come around don't nobody say nothin 
 And you be with the cops, you niggas is McLovin 
 Dark liquor till we busted 
 Till I got a buzz like that nigga Chris Mullen 
 District Of Columbia 
 You Bernie Mac funny, we ain't scared of none of ya! 

[Lady GaGa:] 
 Get em all, get em all, pack it all up 
 Stack up your funds like a million bucks 
 Across the pond, they all know us 
 International... Whoaaaa! 
 Driving my car to a foreign place 
 Lookin at me, now they know my face 
 We want it all now, we got all YESSSS 
 Look At That, Look at how they lookin at usss 

[Wale:] 
 Yeah DC chillin, PG chillin 
 My name WALE and I came to get It 
 Came to get it, Came to get It 
 My name Wale 

[Verse 3:] 
 Dre, pick 'em, ah, pick'em, I'll shut em all down 
 Haters in the crowd, if you see 'em point them out 
 Stacks in my jeans, broads on the scene 
 Folarin be ballin for all ya'll to see 
 Ain't I something? The way I'm stuntin 
 My material girls give 'em A-Rod moneyyy! 
 LV on my luggage 
 Them Bammas goin hate, and I love it, fuck 'em 

[Lady GaGa:] 
 Lookin at, lookin at, Lookin at me 
 Look at that, look how they lookin at me 
 Eyes all sticky like honey on bees 
 Look at that, look how they lookin at me 

[Wale:] 
 DC chillin, PG chillin 
 My name WALE and I came to get It 
 Came to get it, came to get It 
 My name Wale</div>
