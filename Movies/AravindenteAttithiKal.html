	This is one of few films from which I had  much expectations.. 
	THe person who raised the bar for this film was none other than my brother..
	They went to watch this movie when i was in kerala ...but couldnt go due to other commitments...
	Ok now coming back to the positives of this movie...there are a few...first one and the most important..
	Its shot in and around  Upudi's Mookambikha temple...I have been hearing this word for a long time since childhood...
	because people from my village are often visiting these areas for worship.. mostly i have heard this word from my maternal grandmother..
	I also have speacial interest in these places which always reminded me of good times. when I was in Delhi.. and when we used to travel to kerala for our annual vacation..
	These were the same stations which comes just before kerala starts...So I had happy pics saved in my memory abt this place..
	In Movie , when i saw few places it all seemed like my hometown..I was glad and my curiosity grew with the movie progression...
